For HW submission please find 2 files, one excel and one word in this HW1 repo. As I mentioned in the bootcamp submission info, I'd like to have had time to work on the bonus but due to illness and a crazy week I did not. I also found the color-shaded column question to be harder than expected since excel doesn't allow use of "200%" and I needed to ask for assistance to determine the correct values to obtain the proper colors. 

In the excel file the tab "original data" should open first, the others proceeding are the charts and tables.
